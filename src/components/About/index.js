        I am a motivated, entry-level, full-stack web developer looking for opportunities to pursue my passion for technology. I have always been interested in how computers and other technologies work, and I would love nothing more than to continue my education in this field through hands on practice. I recently graduated from both UW-Milwaukee with a BA in Music and from UW-Madison's Extnded Campus Coding Bootcamp. Having experience both with fine arts and with technology gives me a unique outlook that I use for innovative problem solving and excellent communication skills.

        I am currently located in Iowa and am willing to travel or work remotely. My latest project has been a video game concept based on Orson Scott Card's "Enders Game", along with a few other one page applications. I also enjoy playing all types of video games and reading as much as I can, when I am not coding for work or leisure. Please feel free to reach out through the links on my contact page with any questions!
